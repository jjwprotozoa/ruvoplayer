$ sudo snap install ruvo-player
```

### Arch

Also available as an Arch PKG, [ruvo-player-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ruvo-player-bin/), in the AUR (using your favourite AUR-helper, .e.g. `yay`)

```shell
$ yay -S ruvo-player-bin
```

### Prerequisites

   .\start-dev.ps1
   
   # Or batch file
   .\start-dev.bat
   ```
